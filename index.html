					The aim of this project was to design and implement an artefact in the form of a fitness application for use on smartphones devices that use the Android operating system, the application allows users to draw a custom desired route for walking while displaying the number of steps taken for the journey. These results can then be saved in a logbook to retain data in which users can track how much exercise they have done daily.<br><br>Corresponding to the project, an Android application has been designed and implemented for compatible Android devices running versions 8 &amp; 9 of the operating system in conjunction with the objectives set. Although an application has been successfully developed, the choice was made to exclude older versions of the Android operating system as not all models of older phones contain the appropriate sensors for the application to work successfully.&nbsp;<br>

					This project is aimed at medical health practitioners, since there is a need to build interoperable medical healthcare information systems that easily share and understand medical knowledge. One approach to this issue is to use ontologies, which are part of the Semantic Web technology. They help to define vocabularies for a specific domain, which can be communicated and understood by man and machine. Therefore, an ontology containing medical data has been developed. It is used by the Gluon Mobile application that has been created during this project. This application makes suggestions about diseases, recommended treatments and prescriptions based on symptoms that are typed in.

					This paper evaluates Ansible and Kubernetes, both are DevOps distribution tools, in their ability to distribute Docker images across the network with first hand research taking place on Virtual Machines. The findings from this report are important as they will potentially decide on if they want to use containerization to distribute applications to devices in their offices. Furthermore, if they choose against distributing Docker images, they could choose to instead use either Ansible or Kubernetes as a DevOps tool on their own. <br><br>The issue that this project is aiming to provide a solution for is that of inefficiency within the workplace. The main inefficiency is that of completing system updates and installations with most companies completing these updates or installations one at a time.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="linkedin.com/in/jack-hayward-830558175">Linkedin Profile</a><br>

					The goal of this project was to create a prototype of an Augmented Reality Application that can assist an artist by using Artificial Intelligence. It should classify a drawing on a canvas and generate art to inspire the user. This project was influenced by the latest advances in machine learning of Generative Adversarial Networks that can produce realistic art and images. The focus of this project was researching and applying high-level SDKs to combine AI and AR technologies to a proof of concept result. To develop a cross-platform application Unity was used with Vuforia for AR and Tensorflow for AI. After all, generating images on the phone was not possible, so the app uses a classifier to identify a drawing and projects a pre-generated image on the canvas accordingly.<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julius-b√∂cker-23044b164">Linkedin Profile</a><br>

While numerous websites provide functionalities to facilitate shared services, according to multiple authors, platforms for sharing tangible goods are still rare.<br><br>This project aims to study the extent to which a robust and responsive web platform can encourage societies to be shifting towards a sharing economy for goods sharing.

					With a global estimate of over 350 million affected by depression, mental health has become one of the most daunting challenges to manage. Mindiary is an android-based mobile application which focuses on the self-management and self-monitoring aspects of depression by factoring in the importance of lifestyle changes in symptom alleviation. It is an app with a view to assist and not replace professional care. It was created based on tested frameworks for mental health software development and user research.

					Short range wireless communication technology such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Infra-red amongst others has become a very popular medium of communication. However, constraints such as limited connectivity range hinder the prominence of employed devices which are based on these technologies. This project applies a device on device communication that embraces a mesh network topology as a technique for extending the range between/among network nodes.<br> To measure effectiveness, associated parameters such as speed, reliability and scalability were analysed using standard evaluation techniques. Beneficial features including seamless adaptability, expandability and multiple route availability distinctively prove the technique to be suitable for efficient wireless communication.<br>

Evaluation and assessment of the process and final implementation is shown in a results section. <br><br> The results found are that a website with the feature set of the current hardware comparison websites would require extensive planning and implementation. The website created for this report has lots of the features of the competition, however multiple features had to be reduced in complexity or removed. The results survey and usability test show a positive reaction to the website, and that the market that was targeted could be satisfied with a website like this. &nbsp;<br>

Getting treatment for this can be costly and time-consuming and generally requires a form of cognitive behavioural therapy. However; with the rise of Virtual Reality, it is now possible to create realistic environments to explore such phobias.

					This project is centred around the design and implementation of a small scale Virtual Learning Environment, that enables schools and teachers to create and share long-form learning materials to the pupils within their classes. This project was chosen because many primary and secondary schools are unable or reluctant to purchase expensive, overwhelming software for their staff and pupils. Therefore, this project aims to create an easy to use VLE that all schools would benefit using from.<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samjohns97/">Linkedin Profile</a><br>

					<strong><i>Improving efficiency and reducing errors in the event management process through automation</i></strong><br>
				</h4>
				<p class="p-bloc-57-style">
					Clevertouch Marketing is one of Europe's leading Marketing Automation companies who desired a new events management system. Their previous system was simply a piece of paper and a pen which was prone to mistakes being made. To replace this, I developed a new automated process that would reduce or eliminate inaccuracies within the means of signing attendees in or signing up new people who hadn't previously registered. The application was built using Vue.js and Electron along with a few other standard web technologies. It also used Marketo‚ API to pull down the list of contacts and push them back up once the event was over. By using Marketo API, it turned a task that may take several days to complete, into one that takes seconds.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/samwoodley/Gathr">Project Link</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-woodley/">Linkedin Profile</a><br>

					The world of project management is of high reverence in regard to career achievement. However, in terms of its use of modern technology the sector seems to fall short for aiding technologies making the role easier in regard to decision making.

					This project aims to allow insight into how users would be able to watch live sports broadcasts over the VR viewport. This is depending on future technologies and developments taken by broadcasters. This discusses history on VR and how television broadcasting is conducted globally alongside. Considering, football is the most broadcasted sport, could we allow the user to feel as if they are in the stadium watching the game but in reality, they are in the comfort of their own home. A prototype application has been created to allow the user to choose what content they would watch, this has been created through methods explored such as interviews, questionnaires and user testing. Can VR be as beneficial to sports broadcasting than television has for the last century?

Patrick also states that communication also helps a more productive and skilled workforce by allowing for a safe place for employees to share ideas and makes them more comfortable, allowing for more creative brainstorming or problem-solving initiatives . The aim is to investigate if an information system that includes rotas, the ability to book holidays and fix any missed punches as well as including instant messaging and/or a forum, can improve the speed at which employees do their work an improve the efficiency of the store.
